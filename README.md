## Introduction

Sumz is an advanced AI article summarizer application that leverages state-of-the-art technologies to provide a seamless and efficient summarization experience. Our application is crafted with a user-friendly UI, combining the power of React.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Node.js for the runtime environment, a third-party API for article scraping and summarization, and Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query for seamless API Queries.

## Features

1. **Beautiful UI:** Sumz provides an elegant and intuitive user interface designed with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. This ensures a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience.

2. **Effortless Summarization:** Summarizing articles has never been easier. With Sumz, you can summarize articles using the cutting-edge OpenAI GPT-4 model. Simply provide the URL of the article, and Sumz will generate a concise summary for you.

3. **Local Storage Integration:** Sumz includes a feature to save the summarized articles in your local storage. This prevents the need for re-fetching the same articles from the third-party API, saving you time and resources.

4. **URL History:** Keep track of the articles you've browsed with Sumz. Our application maintains a history of the URLs you've visited, making it easy to revisit articles or access their summaries at any time.

5. **Clipboard Link Saving:** Sumz offers a handy feature for saving article links to your clipboard with a single click. This feature simplifies the process of sharing and referencing articles.

6. **Loading Animation:** Sumz displays a loading animation while the summarized article is being fetched from the API. This not only keeps you informed but also adds a touch of interactivity to the process.
